                    <p>Skin diseases consist of both dangerous and non-dangerous types. Some of the non-dangerous types do not need consultation because they can restore itself until they heal, for example, Atopic Dermatitis found in Thailand 10-20% in children and 1-3% in adults, while some skin diseases can be lethal. But normal people are uninformed about the danger of their current skin diseases so they panic to go to the hospital to know how to treat, prompting congestion, and this affects the amount of work of medical personnel i.e. doctors, nurses, and receptionists to increase. Therefore, having software that is easily accessible and helps to classify skin diseases can be beneficial in many cases such as reducing hospital congestion, reducing pollution problems from using vehicles to the hospital, and not wasting time to see a doctor. Based on the preliminary information, we are interested in developing a web application for skin disease classification using machine learning.</p>

                    <p>Now it works with 4 diseases including Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Psoriasis (PS), Seborrhoeic Keratosis (SK) and Normal skin (NM)</p>
